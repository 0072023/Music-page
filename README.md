My First Music Page
Welcome to my music page project! ðŸŽµ

This repository contains my first attempt at creating a music-themed webpage after learning HTML and CSS. This project was a great opportunity for me to apply my initial knowledge and experiment with design and layout to create a visually appealing and functional page.

Note
This page is still in its early stages and may appear somewhat simple and not very attractive. I am in the learning process and working on improving the design and features over time. The current simplicity reflects my early development phase and my journey to enhance my skills.

What You'll Find Here
HTML: Basic structure of the page, including audio elements and information about the music.
CSS: Styles to make the page visually pleasing, with colors, fonts, and responsive layouts.
Features
Music Information Display: Details about the music or artist, such as title, album, and other relevant information.
Audio Player: An integrated audio player to listen to the music directly on the page.
Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
Contributions
This is a personal project, and for now, I am not accepting external contributions. However, I am open to feedback and suggestions to improve the page.
